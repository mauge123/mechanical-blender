# Mechanical-blender
Mechanical Blender project is fork of blender BF-Project

## Purpose

The purpose of Mechanical Blender is the development of tools and fork blender source to allow blender
be a CAD software that could be used on industry. All changes will be performed in a way that
commitment in blender official trunk could be done easily if the community and the Blender foundation consider
it as convenient.

We wont a professional software to be used for companies and individuals that

* Want to be free and no to be imposed the OS, and upgrades (soft, and hardware)
* Don't want to be married with a company and a software.
* Give importance to code, not only the binaries.
* Cannot afford the expensive prices of licenses and they want to be legal.

## Builds

### Changes and improvements from BF-Blender

* User is capable to select base points for transformations, using B key
* 3D cursor is set as snap element, so transformations can refer to it.
* User is capable to change snap element list during transformation using the shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+TAB

## Compile

To be compiled you must enable WITH_MECHANICAL flag. Once enable compile as usual done for bf-blender

## Branches

### master

This branch will be periodically updated with bf-blender trunk.

The mechanical branches will be also merged here periodically

### mechanical-dimensions

This branch starts from bf-blender trunk.

currently on development

### mechanical-grab-w-basepoint

This branch starts from bf-blender trunk.

The branch should be tested in other areas of Blender than 3D space editor.

### mechanical-grab-w-basepoint-bf

This branchs starts from mechanical-grab-w-basepoint and is intended to get a diff to be applied directly to Bf Blender

see https://developer.blender.org/D1501

### mechanical-rotate-w-basepoint

This branchs starts from mechanical-grab-w-basepoint.
This branch is merged down to mechanical-grab-w-basepoint.
